          A sports car is a type of car that is designed with an emphasis on
          dynamic performance, such as handling, acceleration, top speed, the
          thrill of driving, and racing capability. Sports cars originated in
          Europe in early 1910s and are currently produced by many manufacturers
          around the world.

          Traditionally, the most common layout for sports cars was a roadster
          (a two-seat car without a fixed roof),[27] however there are also
          several examples of early sports cars with four seats.[5]
